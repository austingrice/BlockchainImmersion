# Blockchain Immersion Workshop (BKCHN1)
 
## Lab Notes:

The IP address for your Ubuntu on IBM Z instance for the remaining workshop labs is **192.168.22.xx** where *xx* is your team number + 100,  e.g.  team 02's IP is 192.168.22.**102**, team 10's IP is 192.168.22.**110**, etc. Any place in the labs where you see an IP address of the form *192.168.22.xx*, please make sure you subsitute the proper IP address as appropriate.  **Note:** There are not too many cases where this occurs, but when it does, you may have to do some manual typing so that you don't accidentally copy and paste and use the wrong IP address.
